# AI-Based Object Detection System using YOLOv8 & Streamlit

This is a major BCA project that performs real-time object detection on
images, videos, and live webcam feed using the YOLOv8 deep learning model.
The application is built with Streamlit to provide a simple web-based interface.

## Features
- Image Object Detection
- Video Object Detection
- Live Webcam Detection (Local System)
- Real-time bounding boxes and labels
- Streamlit web interface

## Technology Stack
- Python
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- Streamlit
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pillow

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Create and activate virtual environment
3. Install dependencies:

--pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the app:

--python -m streamlit run app.py


## Deployment
The project is deployed using Streamlit Cloud.
(Live webcam feature works only on local system due to cloud limitations.)
